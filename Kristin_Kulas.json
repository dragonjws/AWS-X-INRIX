Some of the problems on the assignments are quite a bit more difficult than shown in class. Midterms were fine if you understood the homework. Relatively tame weekly quizzes. Very generous with partial credit.",

You can get an A until the end and the final is not what she teaches and your lab grade gets included in your final grade so it gets diluted as well.  Very unfair final exam and does not curve!!!  Nice Professor but just lip service!!! Class final average was 30/50.",
